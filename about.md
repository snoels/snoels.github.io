## About me

Hello, my name is **Sander**! :wave:

I am currently doing an industrial Ph.D. in computer science while working as a data scientist at Silverfin. I am associated with the Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis research group ([AIDA](https://aida.ugent.be/)) of [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en). Currently, I am focused on the use of machine learning for company benchmarking, which allows [Silverfin](https://www.silverfin.com/) to quantify the similarity between companies. 

Besides my focus on company benchmarking, I am also interested in graph machine learning and private machine learning.
